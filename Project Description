Nice — I’ll design a complete project brief to build a Google NotebookLM-like product using open-source building blocks plus OpenAI **Agents** for the agentic parts. It includes: high-level product description, user capabilities, an engineering code-flow (components + pseudocode), phased roadmap with deliverables, and a recommended tech stack (open-source + OpenAI). I’ve included practical implementation notes and where to plug the OpenAI Agents SDK. Citations for key references are included.

# Project: “OpenNotebook” — NotebookLM-style research & thinking partner

## 1) Product summary (what we’re building)

OpenNotebook is an AI research assistant that ingests a user’s documents (PDFs, slides, web pages, notes) and turns them into searchable, interactive notebooks that support:

* fast **document ingestion** and multi-format parsing (PDF, DOCX, HTML, images → OCR).
* **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** Q\&A over user knowledge with provenance and citation links.
* **Auto-summaries**: multi-level summaries (one-line → paragraph → briefing doc → study guide).
* **Multi-modal outputs**: mind maps, narrated slide/video overviews, audio summaries.
* **Persistent notebooks** with versioning, sharing, access control, and export.
* **Agentic workflows**: agents that can run research tasks (gather extra sources, run code, produce slide decks) using tools (web search, file search, external APIs).
* **Personalization & memory**: project-level memory, user preferences, and domain fine-tuning.
* **Enterprise-grade security and audit logs** (encryption at rest/in transit, access logs).

These are aligned with the features Google NotebookLM and its Studio capabilities and the agent patterns that OpenAI recommends for tool-using agents. ([Google NotebookLM][1])

# 2) Core system architecture (high level)

1. **Frontend** — React (SPA) with editor, notebook UI, studio (outputs gallery), and visualizations (mind maps, slides player).
2. **API Gateway / Backend** — FastAPI / Node.js server exposing REST / WebSocket endpoints. Handles auth, jobs, and orchestration.
3. **Ingestion & Preprocessing** — workers that parse files, OCR images, split text (smart chunking), extract metadata.
4. **Embeddings & Vector Store (RAG)** — create embeddings per chunk and store in vector DB (Weaviate/Milvus/FAISS).
5. **Retriever & Reranker** — similarity search + optionally offline BM25 / dense + sparse hybrid reranker.
6. **LLM layer & Agents orchestrator** — OpenAI Responses/Agents SDK as the primary reasoning model and agent orchestrator (or hybrid with local open models for cheaper/air-gapped use). Agents call tools: file\_search, web\_search, code runner, slide generator, TTS. ([OpenAI Cookbook][2])
7. **Tools & Connectors** — web crawler, browserless search connector, Google Drive / OneDrive / Notion connectors, internal file search.
8. **Multimedia generator** — TTS, image/slide generator (stable diffusion or similar), video assembly.
9. **Persistence & Security** — DB (Postgres), object storage (S3), audit logs, KMS for encryption.
10. **Observability & Eval** — logs, user feedback loop, evals for agent outputs (Evals / Langfuse / custom). ([The New Stack][3])

# 3) Code flow / module structure (developer view)

Below is the logical flow and representative pseudocode for the main request path: *User asks a question about a notebook*.

## 3.1 Flow steps

1. User queries via frontend → request to Backend `/query` with notebook id + prompt.
2. Backend: fetch user profile & notebook permissions.
3. Retriever: embed prompt → vector DB search → top-k chunks.
4. Reranker (optional): run cross-encoder to reorder chunks.
5. Agent orchestration: create “agent context” containing user prompt + top chunks + tools list.
6. Agent chooses actions (e.g., call file\_search tool, call web\_search tool, call generator tool).
7. Agent collects tool outputs → final LLM response with structured citations and optional multimodal outputs.
8. Backend returns response to frontend; store conversation & provenance; record telemetry & user feedback.

## 3.2 Pseudocode (Python-ish)

```python
# high-level pseudo
def handle_user_query(user_id, notebook_id, prompt):
    assert check_permission(user_id, notebook_id)
    top_chunks = retriever.search(notebook_id, prompt, k=12)
    context = build_agent_context(prompt, top_chunks, user_settings(user_id))
    # Create an agent task using OpenAI Agents SDK (pseudo)
    agent = OpenAIAgents.create_agent(
        instructions=DEFAULT_RESEARCH_AGENT_INSTRUCTIONS,
        tools=[file_search_tool, web_search_tool, slide_gen_tool, code_runner_tool],
        memory=get_notebook_memory(notebook_id)
    )
    result = agent.run(context)
    store_provenance(result, top_chunks, user_id, notebook_id)
    return result.to_client_payload()
```

## 3.3 Example tool interface

* `file_search_tool(query, notebook_id)` → searches notebook files (supports function-callable tool pattern).
* `web_search_tool(query, max_results=5)` → returns list of candidate URLs + short snippet.
* `slide_gen_tool(document_chunks, template)` → returns slide deck (.pptx) or slide images.
  These are implemented as secure microservices callable by agent via function calling or the Agents SDK. See OpenAI agent guide patterns. ([OpenAI][4])

# 4) Tech stack (recommended, open-source + OpenAI)

### LLM / Agents & Reasoning

* **Primary reasoning / agent orchestration**: **OpenAI Agents / Responses API** (agents SDK + function calling) — for best agent tooling and tool integrations. ([OpenAI Cookbook][2])
* **Optional local models** (for offline / privacy / cost): Llama 2, Mistral, GPT-Q quantized models (via Hugging Face + Text Generation Inference) — use for local embeddings or fallback generations.

### Retrieval & embeddings

* **Embeddings provider**: OpenAI embeddings (for quality) or open alternatives (sentence-transformers, OpenAI alternative models).
* **Vector DB** (open source options): **Weaviate**, **Milvus**, or **FAISS** (self-hosted). For managed option, Pinecone. ([Apify Blog][5])

### Orchestration & frameworks

* **LangChain** or **LlamaIndex** for RAG + agent patterns (or roll your own orchestration using the OpenAI Agents SDK). LangChain remains the most commonly used framework for agents and RAG fan-out. ([meilisearch.com][6])

### Backend & infra

* **API**: FastAPI / Node.js (Express/Nest)
* **Queue / Workers**: Redis + Celery / RQ / RabbitMQ for background jobs (ingestion, long-running agent tasks).
* **DB**: Postgres (notebooks, users, metadata)
* **Object Storage**: S3-compatible (MinIO for self-hosted)
* **Auth**: OAuth2 (Google sign-in optional), role-based ACLs.
* **KMS / Secrets**: HashiCorp Vault or cloud KMS.
* **Observability**: Prometheus + Grafana, plus tracing (Jaeger) and logs (ELK / Loki).

### Frontend & UX

* **Frontend**: React + Tailwind (or design system). Use a notebook editor (ProseMirror / TipTap) for rich text and attachments.
* **Visualization**: D3 / visx for mind maps, deck.gl or custom slides player for video overviews.
* **Media**: TTS engines (OpenAI TTS or open-source like Coqui), image gen (Stable Diffusion), video assembly (FFmpeg automations).

# 5) Phased roadmap (MVP → 3 major phases)

## MVP (4–8 weeks) — core RAG Q\&A + notebooks

**Goals**

* Notebook creation, upload PDF/DOCX, basic parsing & OCR.
* Embeddings + vector DB search.
* LLM-backed Q\&A over notebook with provenance (show which doc/chunk answered).
* Simple UI: upload, search, Q\&A chat, view docs.
  **Tech choices**
* FastAPI backend, React frontend, FAISS or Weaviate, OpenAI embeddings + responses (non-agent flow), LangChain for glue.
  **Deliverables**
* Working demo: upload 10 documents, ask questions, see citations and short summaries.

## Phase 2 (8–12 weeks) — agents & studio outputs

**Goals**

* Integrate OpenAI Agents SDK for tool-using agent workflows (web search, file search).
* Add summarization flows (briefing doc, multi-level summaries).
* Add slide & audio generation (basic TTS + auto slide generator).
  **Tech choices**
* OpenAI Agents & function calling, Weaviate, LangChain agent patterns, FFmpeg + TTS for audio. ([OpenAI Cookbook][2])
  **Deliverables**
* Agent templates (Researcher agent, Slide-builder agent), Studio UI for saved outputs.

## Phase 3 (12–16 weeks) — multimodal, personalization, enterprise

**Goals**

* Mind maps & video overviews (AI-generated visuals + narration).
* Notebook sharing, versioning, enterprise auth & SSO.
* Offline/local model support, end-to-end encryption for sensitive notebooks.
  **Tech choices**
* Stable Diffusion / Dreambooth for images, OpenAI or Coqui TTS for audio, KMS for keys.
  **Deliverables**
* Production-ready product with enterprise auth, audit logs, admin console.

## Phase 4 — polish, scale, fine-tuning

**Goals**

* Monitoring, user feedback loop, automated evals of agent outputs, model fine-tuning on anonymized corpora.
* Cost optimization: hybrid LLM usage (local cheap models for drafts; OpenAI agents for final reasoning). ([The New Stack][3])

---

# 6) Security, privacy & compliance notes

* **Data residency & encryption**: option to keep vectors/keys on-premises (Weaviate + self-hosted embedding models).
* **Provenance**: always attach chunk ID + source URL + snippet to generated answers.
* **User controls**: per-notebook export/delete, redact sensitive docs, consent for using docs for model fine-tuning.
* **Audit & Evals**: log agent tool calls; run Evals to measure hallucination and accuracy. ([The New Stack][3])

---

# 7) Observability & evaluation strategy

* Capture candidate evidence sources returned by retriever and mark which were used in final generation.
* Collect user feedback (thumbs up/down) on each answer; feed into a human-in-the-loop retraining/eval pipeline.
* Use structured Evals for agent behaviors (tool use correctness, safe tool calls). ([OpenAI][4])

# 9) Quick implementation tips & pitfalls

* **Chunking matters**: tune chunk size and overlap; includes metadata (page#, fileid) so you can cite precisely.
* **Reranking helps**: a cheap cross-encoder reranker can dramatically improve answer quality.
* **Tool safety & guardrails**: agents with web access must have strict rate limits, allowlist/denylist, and prompt-level guardrails. See OpenAI agent design patterns. ([OpenAI][4])

If you want, I can now:

* produce a **detailed sprint plan** with tasks for the first two sprints (MVP) and estimated engineering roles; **or**
* generate **skeleton code** for the backend retriever + a minimal agent orchestrator using the OpenAI Agents SDK (Python) and Weaviate/FAISS integrations; **or**
* create UI wireframes for the notebook and Studio pages.
